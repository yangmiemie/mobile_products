      We hope that this textbook provides you with an enjoyable introduction to the field of
      algorithms. We have attempted to make every algorithm accessible and interesting. To help
      you when you encounter unfamiliar or difficult algorithms, we describe each one in a step-bystep
      manner. We also provide careful explanations of the mathematics needed to understand
      the analysis of the algorithms. If you already have some familiarity with a topic, you will find
      the chapters organized so that you can skim introductory sections and proceed quickly to the
      more advanced material.

      ***************************Profile*****************************<br>
      If you wish to implement any of the algorithms, you will find the translation of our
      pseudocode into your favorite programming language a fairly straightforward task. The
      pseudocode is designed to present each algorithm clearly and succinctly. Consequently, we do
      not address error-handling and other software-engineering issues that require specific
      assumptions about your programming environment. We attempt to present each algorithm
      simply and directly without allowing the idiosyncrasies of a particular programming language
      to obscure its essence.

      We have included over 920 exercises and over 140 problems. Each section ends with
      exercises, and each chapter ends with problems. The exercises are generally short questions
      that test basic mastery of the material. Some are simple self-check thought exercises, whereas
      others are more substantial and are suitable as assigned homework. The problems are more
      elaborate case studies that often introduce new material; they typically consist of several
      questions that lead the student through the steps required to arrive at a solution.

      ***************************Setting*****************************<br>
      You should find it easy to organize your course around just the chapters you need. We have
      made chapters relatively self-contained, so that you need not worry about an unexpected and
      unnecessary dependence of one chapter on another. Each chapter presents the easier material
      first and the more difficult material later, with section boundaries marking natural stopping
      points. In an undergraduate course, you might use only the earlier sections from a chapter; in
      a graduate course, you might cover the entire chapter.
